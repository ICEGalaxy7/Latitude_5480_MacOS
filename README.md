EFI for Dell Latitude 5480 on Monterey and (Big sur)

My Specs
*CPU : i5 6300U
*iGPU : HD Graphics 520
*RAM : 2x8Gb SK Hynix 2400MHz DDR4 (runs at 2133MHz)
*Audio : Realtek ALC256
*SSD : Stock 256Gb Intel M.2 SATA III
...

What's not Working : 
*Bluetooth detects other devices but can't maintain the connection (therefore, Airdrop too isn't working)
*SD Card Reader Not Tested but a kext for it is included
*Fan Control, Undected by 3rd party apps, but are working
*Brightness Keys (F11 and F12)

What's Working :
*HDMI with Audio
*Headphone Jack
*VGA
*Keyboard and Touchpad with Gestures
and almost everything I can recall...


I was able to achieve this thanks to the help of Jake Lo from [osxlatitude.com](https://osxlatitude.com) :-)
